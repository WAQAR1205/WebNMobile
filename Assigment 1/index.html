            <b> <i> ASSALAAM-O-WALIKUM </i> </b>
            and welcome to my profile! My name is Muhammad Waqar Ulhaque, and I am a current Bachelor's
            student in Computer Science. My passion for technology led me to pursue a web and mobile
            application development course, where I gained knowledge and experience in HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and ReactJS. In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong command of
            mathematics topics such as Calculus, Differential Equations, Discrete Math, Probability,
            and Statistics. I believe that a strong foundation in mathematics is critical in
            developing logical and analytical thinking skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am actively seeking an
            internship opportunity in the industry where I can apply my technical and mathematical
            knowledge to real-world problems. I am confident in my abilities to adapt to new
            challenges and to work collaboratively with a team to achieve common goals.
            Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you!
        </p>
