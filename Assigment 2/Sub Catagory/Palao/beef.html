            Beef Pulao, also known as Beef Pilaf, is a popular dish in Karachi, Pakistan. It consists of tender beef
            pieces cooked with aromatic spices and fragrant Basmati rice. Beef Pulao can be found at various local
            eateries, restaurants, and food stalls in Karachi, where it is prepared with authentic flavors and quality
            ingredients. The beef is marinated and slow-cooked with a blend of spices, resulting in tender and flavorful
            meat. Basmati rice is added to the cooked beef, allowing it to absorb the flavors and aromas. Beef Pulao is
            commonly garnished with fried onions, coriander leaves, and mint leaves. It is often served with raita,
            salad, and sometimes accompanied by pickles or chutneys. Beef Pulao is enjoyed during special occasions,
            gatherings, and as a comforting family meal in Karachi.
