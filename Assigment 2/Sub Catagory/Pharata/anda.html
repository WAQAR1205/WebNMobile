            Anda Paratha, or Egg Paratha, is a popular breakfast dish in Karachi, Pakistan. It features a flaky and
            layered paratha filled with spiced eggs. Anda Paratha is commonly found at local eateries and breakfast
            joints in Karachi, where it is served with chutney, yogurt, or pickle. It is a delicious and filling option
            enjoyed by tearing off pieces of the paratha and dipping them into the accompanying condiments.
