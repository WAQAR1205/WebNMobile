            Mango Shake is a popular beverage in Karachi, Pakistan. It is made from ripe mangoes blended with milk,
            sugar, and ice to create a thick and creamy drink. Mango Shakes are commonly found at juice bars, cafes, and
            street vendors in Karachi, particularly during the mango season. It is a refreshing and indulgent way to
            enjoy the natural sweetness and flavor of ripe mangoes.
