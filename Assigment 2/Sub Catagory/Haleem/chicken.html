            Chicken Haleem is a popular dish in Karachi, Pakistan, enjoyed during special occasions and religious
            festivals like Ramadan. It is a slow-cooked dish that combines shredded chicken, lentils, wheat, and spices
            to create a thick and porridge-like consistency. In Karachi, Chicken Haleem can be found at local eateries,
            street food stalls, and restaurants specializing in Pakistani cuisine. The dish is known for its rich and
            creamy texture, as well as its aromatic flavors from a blend of spices. Chicken Haleem is typically
            garnished with fried onions, fresh coriander leaves, ginger slices, and a squeeze of lemon. It is commonly
            served with naan bread or rice and provides a satisfying and comforting meal experience.
