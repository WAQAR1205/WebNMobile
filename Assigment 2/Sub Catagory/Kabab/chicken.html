            Chicken Kabab is a popular dish in Karachi, Pakistan, available at various eateries and food stalls
            throughout the city. It comes in different variations such as seekh kabab, reshmi kabab, malai kabab, and
            tikka kabab, each with its own distinct flavors and preparation methods. Seekh kababs are made from ground
            chicken mixed with spices and grilled on skewers, while reshmi kababs are marinated in a creamy mixture and
            have a tender texture. Malai kababs are marinated in a creamy yogurt and cream mixture, and tikka kababs are
            marinated in tangy and spicy flavors, giving them a smoky taste. Chicken kababs are commonly served with
            naan bread, salad, and chutneys. They can be enjoyed as appetizers or as a main course with rice or bread.
            Karachi offers a wide range of options for chicken kababs, catering to different tastes and preferences.
