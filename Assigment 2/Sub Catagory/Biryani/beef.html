            Beef Biryani is a popular and aromatic rice dish that originated in Karachi.
            It consists of layers of tender beef and basmati rice, cooked with a blend of spices
            and herbs. The beef is marinated with yogurt and spices before being cooked until
            tender. The rice is parboiled and flavored with whole spices. The meat and rice are
            layered together and slow-cooked to allow the flavors to blend. Beef Biryani is often
            garnished with fried onions, cilantro, and lemon wedges. It is a beloved dish for its
            rich taste and is commonly served at festive occasions and family gatherings.
