            Sada Khushbu Pan, or Plain Pan, is a traditional variant of pan enjoyed in Karachi, Pakistan. It consists of
            a fresh betel leaf that is folded or rolled and spread with slaked lime. Sada Khushbu Pan offers a mild and
            refreshing flavor and is appreciated for its simplicity. It is commonly consumed as a mouth freshener and
            digestive aid after meals in Karachi. You can find Sada Khushbu Pan at paan shops, street vendors, and
            traditional outlets throughout the city.
